# AI data science teaching assistant
Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered global interest and sparked widespread fascination. Commonly known as "foundation models," their true value comes from the flexibility to tailor them for specific functions across an extensive range of applications. With the technology evolving swiftly, there exists a significant chance to discover optimal strategies and techniques for customizing LLMs for novel and niche tasks.
The goal of this project is to create a notebook that demonstrates how to use the Gemma LLM to explain or teach basic data science concepts.
